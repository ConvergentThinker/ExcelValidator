# ExcelValidator

As test automation engineers,
we all know how frustrating it can be to deal with irrelevant,
duplicated, or empty data cells in Excel before running the automation test scripts. This is because we forgot to Validate the Excel which will come from another source. It can slow down the entire business process costing time and resources.That's where the Pandora box comes in - it's a powerful tool designed to help you quickly and easily validate your test data.

The Tool will verify, validate the MS Excel against set of rules. Rules will be stored and injected from outside.

for example:
- column A should be a String(text)
- column B is sum of Column (A + C)
- format checking, like cell contains text in the date formate MM-DD-YYY
- Mandatory cells in particular column
- set of accepted values - Custom calculation/rules for certain cell

I need all of your help to collect requirements or problems you might have faced or suggestion or pain points.If you have any thoughts, leave them in the comments .
